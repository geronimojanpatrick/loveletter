        <p align="justify">Love means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want, no matter how much it destroys you. And when you love someone, you just don't stop. Ever. Even if people roll their eyes or call you crazy, even then. Especially then! You just don't give up because if I would give up, take the whole world's advice, move on and find someone else, that wouldn't be love. That would be some other disposable thing that is not worth fighting for. But my love, this is not what it is. Always remember this:<br><br><marquee behavior="scroll"><h3>I will love you for as long as I can, for as long as the universe would allow me to. I will love you until the end of my days...and beyond.</h3></marquee><br><br>I’m in love with you, and I’m not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I’m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we’re all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we’ll ever have, and I am in love with you.</p>

    <p>And now, these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.</p>
