You hold me in your arms, and say nothing more than that you love me. I love you for the look you give me. You're proud to be with me. You're a good listener. You always remind me that everything is going to be okay.<br><br><marquee behavior="scroll"><h3>YOU MAKE ME HAPPY, MY LOVE!</h3></marquee><br><br>My heart beats wildly for you. My pulse quickens whenever you are near. My brain churns constant thoughts of you, and my body aches for you. I simply can't help but react to you in every way. So, yes I love you. Not only do I love you. I want you. I desire you. I yearn you. Deeply. Constantly. Always.</p>
